<center><p style="color:Fuchsia;">The lamborghini is a very well known car. It is meant to look good and be fast.The most known kind of lamborghini is the Lamborghini aventador or the lamborghini mercyalago. When you see them you see flash and class. Unlike if you saw a smart car roll up to your school youd think eww but then you see a lamborghini veneno cruise up youd think"ok thats a awsome car".The lamborghini's logo is a bull/tarus because its the founders zodaic sign. the founder ferruicio lamborghini was particularly interested in spanish bull fighting. That is why the logo is a bull/tarus.</p></center>
